Creativity comes and goes like the wind, right? When inspiration strikes, you jump at the chance and let the energy flow through you. But what do you do when the magic doesn't come?

Creativity is to be cultivated. Nourished. Loved.

It isn't something that just *happens* to you...it's up to you to set the right conditions to create. This is a much more empowering perspective, putting the reins in your hands instead of leaving it up to fate's wheel of fortune.

The key with creativity is consistency -- and consistency means *structure*. Make it easy for yourself to create by setting up a space dedicated to your craft. It can help if this space is solely focused on your art, with all the supplies and materials you need to create -- and nothing else. Set aside a time every day or every week to focus on your expression and honing your craft. When you actually put it on your schedule, you validate your work and give it its due.


## Creativity loves structure

Wait, what? Isn't art and expression all about free flow and spontaneity?

Flow and structure are two lovers in an eternal dance. The river cannot flow without the bed and banks to guide it. Your creativity will flow with ease and grace when you simply give yourself the space and time you deserve.


## All creativity is transformation

A sacred mission into yourself to find what is yearning to die and be reborn. What in you has lived its life and is now ready to start fresh and begin anew? What has run the course of your inner world and is ready to be brought to light?

So many pains, struggles, traumas, and shadows are lying inside of us...this is no tragedy! They are fuel for the fire of creativity. Any trouble you've had is the seed of a good story...and all creativity is at its core story telling.

Honour your process. Dive deep within and feel into each step of the way, seeing the essential role it plays on your journey to the seed of your expression. Find it. Find this quality within that seeks rebirth...for it is the kindling to light the fire of your inspiraiton.

When you falter, bring your awareness back to this shadow that wants to shine -- and see its potential, envision the light it wants to be come. Use this vision to fuel your action, driving you forward not with force, but with love. Love for the beauty you are creating. Love for the life you are crafting. Love for the transformation you are seeking.

Yes, it takes courage to create, to rise above our fear of failure and imperfection. Yet it is precisely this fear of failure that wants to become greatness. Love the fear and you will transcend it. Love the shadow and you will transform it into light.
