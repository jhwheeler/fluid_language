## 1. Lively

	I see, hear, taste, smell, touch something...

## 2. Striking

	...this creates an image in my mind of a desire, an idea, a vector.
	Yet, say that this desire is one I know deep within myself
	to be unaligned with my highest good.
	A method of self-soothing,
	self-sedation,
	self-oblivion...
	that I may believe to bring me 
	pleasure,
	satisfaction
	-- but in the end
	simply drain 
	my body,
	my mind,
	my being,
	rather than replenish, nourish, fulfill!

	A choice lies before me,
	a fork in the road:
	ignore this inner knowing,
	and slip into the desire anyway,
	believing its false promises...
	or stand up
	and follow my soul's compass
	to the heart of the now.

	Now, I take one of these roads.
	What follows...depends on which one.

	Option A, eh?
	Yeah, fuck it!
	Go for it, you only live once, right?
	Consequences be damned...haha!
	Yup, this is fun...see you in the morning!

	...hi
	yeah,
	just woke up

	...

	never doing that again.

	OK, so what about Option B?

	What if I listen to myself,
	my intuition,
	my inner voice,
	and instead of letting the monkey mind
	jump at the most minor whim of the monkey body,
	I do two simple things:
	drink water, and pray.

	Cool, smooth, fresh
	water...
	the juice of life,
	the ultimate source,
	the purest nectar.

	Thank God for this bliss!
	Water is life, water is love.
	It's so simple...
	drink and pray, drink and pray, drink and pray...

## 4. Subtle

	How do you pray, you ask?

	Two ways:
	gratitude and inquiry.

	Praise the source of creation 
	for this water,
	this life,
	this bliss.

	And lay 
	your burdens,
	your questions,
	your sorrows,
	your complaints,
	your yearnings,
	your queries
	here
	at the altar of life,
	this cup of water,
	this goblet of divine nectar.

	Ask and you shall receive.

	Give yourself to the moment,
	and unto you will be given
	all of eternity.
