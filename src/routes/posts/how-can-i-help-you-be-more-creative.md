When you create, I bloom. When you express, I flourish. When you share, I thrive.

Connection inspires -- when two worlds collide, a new reality is born out of the dance.

What is a muse? A light that shows the way, a spark of flame that pushes you forward without you knowing where you're going. There is no way to know the way forward, but you trust, you feel, you give it your all and what comes comes. This is the only way to truly express fully and raw, real, vibing it fully without any hesitancy. Why stop, why wait, why hesitate? What will it give you? Just feel into it and dive in. This light, this muse, she is always available to you. There is no need to wait for the perfect moment...she is always here.

The goddess showing her full glory in every moment, she is right here in your very breath. You are your own muse, for the goddess lives deep within your heart. Every breath you take is an ode to her, a sonnet to the glory of the divine feminine, seducing you deeper within yourself to discover the truth that lies within.

Seeing every breath as a path to inspiration, seeing every person you meet as your muse. Everyone you meet is your teacher, everyone you meet is your muse. What about this person inspires you? What about this person makes you curious? What about this person do you want to celebrate? Sing it now!

Her vivacity, her vibrant flourishes, her flair, her hair... The soft and gentle power she exudes in her every movement. Her every dance step so aligned and in flow, embodying fully the emotions she feels so fully... How could I not be inspired by her? Wild and raw, yet so refined...what is this effervescent balance and harmony of opposites so elegantly combined into one effortless, overflowing stream of love...ever flowing, ever going...it flows and it flows and it flows.

The sparkles of light that emanate from your laughter, the full-bodied taste of your yoni, the rich and sensuous texture of your soft skin. How I thirst for your taste, how I pine for your smell.

Cute bubbles of air bouncing about in the air around her make me feel buoyant, alive, vivacious! How can it be? What is this world opening before me? I have never felt so embodied, so full, so feeling! I feel myself more fully through the fullness of my feeling her. I never knew this was possible. God, I love her so much.

What is the action now? What can I do to cultivate this love? How can I nourish this connection? What can we create together?

It is this, here and now. Creating, writing, expressing. Fully feeling into my body and my heart and allowing the words to fall out of my fingers like so many drops from the top of a waterfall. This flow of creation is the key to expression and the key to love, connection, communion. This communion that we feel, this is the divine communion of lover and beloved, seer and seen, a never-ending dance of expression and reception, sharing and holding space.

How I love to feel her, to hold her. How I love to hear her gales of laughter cascading over my heart...who am I to deserve such grace, such bliss? The purity of my gratitude is tested in every moment by this divine creature, this muse of mine. This muse of her own.

Now how can I help her be more creative, how I can help myself be more creative? Nourishing, encouraging, yes -- but what specifically?

One of my gifts is structure. I can help provide mental structure to her, so her flow can be directed as she sees fit, as is most harmonious and beautiful in the moment. With a solid structure, she can release completely, surrender into her own power and fully express in her wild, raw dance of creation. The structure of Harmony, the invisible design that need not come to the forefront, yet is always there, on a subtle level, hidden in the background.

This is my ultimate dharma -- to be the pillars holding up the magnificent splendor and opulence of the temple. That is my role, that is my path -- to be the architect of the world's flourishing, the world's blossoming into its own power, beauty, and harmony.
