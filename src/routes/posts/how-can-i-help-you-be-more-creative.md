When you create, I bloom. When you express, I flourish. When you share, I thrive.

Connection inspires -- when two worlds collide, a new reality is born out of the dance.

What is a muse? A light that shows the way, a spark of flame that pushes you forward without you knowing where you're going. There is no way to know the way forward, but you trust, you feel, you give it your all and what comes comes. This is the only way to truly express fully and raw, real, vibing it fully without any hesitancy. Why stop, why wait, why hesitate? What will it give you? Just feel into it and dive in. This light, this muse, she is always available to you. There is no need to wait for the perfect moment...she is always here.

The goddess showing her full glory in every moment, she is right here in your very breath. You are your own muse, for the goddess lives deep within your heart. Every breath you take is an ode to her, a sonnet to the glory of the divine feminine, seducing you deeper within yourself to discover the truth that lies within.

Seeing every breath as a path to inspiration, seeing every person you meet as your muse. Everyone you meet is your teacher, everyone you meet is your muse. What about this person inspires you? What about this person makes you curious? What about this person do you want to celebrate? Sing it now!

What is the action now? What can I do to cultivate this love? How can I nourish this connection? What can we create together?

It is this, here and now. Creating, writing, expressing. Fully feeling into my body and my heart and allowing the words to fall out of my fingers like so many drops from the top of a waterfall. This flow of creation is the key to expression and the key to love, connection, communion. This communion that we feel, this is the divine communion of lover and beloved, seer and seen, a never-ending dance of expression and reception, sharing and holding space.

How I can help myself be more creative?

I can create provide mental structure, so the flow can be directed as the heart sees fit, as is most harmonious and beautiful in the moment. With a solid structure, the heart can release completely, surrender into its own power and fully express in its wild, raw dance of creation. The structure of Harmony, the invisible design that need not come to the forefront, yet is always there, on a subtle level, hidden in the background.

This is my ultimate dharma -- to be the pillars holding up the magnificent splendor and opulence of the temple. That is my role, that is my path -- to be the architect of the world's flourishing, the world's blossoming into its own power, beauty, and harmony.
