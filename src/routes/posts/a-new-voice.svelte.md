What am I letting go of that no longer serves me, what have I learned in 2021 that will most help me moving forward, and what new energy am I calling in that will best serve my dharma as I move into 2022?

## Let Go

I let go of the constant seeking of another to complete me. I let go of the need to put others' needs before my own. I let go of seeking validation and love from others in order to feel whole.

## Carry Forward

I carry with me a deepening of my ability to integrate ideas and traditions together. I carry with me an ability to end what no longer serves me. I carry with me a newfound stability and confidence in myself and the Divine.

## Call In

I call in discipline to keep me focused and consistent in my creativity. I call in a teaching role in my community, sharing the wisdom and knowledge God has given me. I call in overflowing creativity to share with others. I call in the true expression of my voice as a vehicle for the Divine.


These reflections inspired a poem: [Open Voice](/posts/open-voice).
