Lord, speak through me.   
My voice, my pen -- your instruments  
Of love and power;  
Two tongues of the same flame,  
Giving strength in an eternal flow.


My heart yearns for your embrace, O Lord.  
To burn in the fire of your altar,  
Drowning in your purity and fullness.  
I see only you, in and around my every  
Breath.

Shine, flood, fill my vision  
With the sweet fire of oneness...

Adonai ha-Aretz, Hallelujah, Elohim  
ॐ  शिव शम्भो । ॐ श्री महादेव शम्भो ॥
