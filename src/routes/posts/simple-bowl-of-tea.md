A flame, a singular flame.  
Dancing in the darkness,  
a portal to light.  

Your fickle flicker delights me so,  
never a dull moment with eternity  
burning in the night.  

Alight the flame  
to brew the herb and thus  
transform leaf to love.  

Drink, drink the sacred brew,  
imbibe these gifts  
of our mother's bosom.  

Ever-giving, overflowing,  
the eternal stream  
of milk and honey.  

This land, a treasure;  
this sky, a portal;  
this sea, a potion.  

An infinite bounty  
in every breath,  
every sip.  

From fire to water  
to tree to breath,  
a journey of endless change and depth.
