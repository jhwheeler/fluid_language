Seeking the perfect starting conditions,  
Striving for all the pieces in place.  
Ideal setting  
Aligned intention  
Harmonious space  
Inspired mood --  
Can't start without these,  
Right?

What if you said,  
Fuck that.

Throw away the interminable conditions  
On your creativity,  
Limitations endlessly applying themselves  
To your expression.

What within me is ready to leave the  
Confines  
Of my inner world?  
What yearns to be released from the infinite vastness of my mind,  
To be manifested  
Here  
Now  
Laid out before you on this page?

Today, it is this  
Ever-stopping,  
Always denying,  
Perfection-seeking  
Idealism

Wait!  
You can't write that -- it doesn't rhyme.  
You can't sing that -- it's off key.  
You can't dance that -- it's off balance.  

No more.  
Sing it, write it, dance it, do it!  
Conditions be damned.  
I do not wait -- I create.
